JPlag currently supports Java, C, C++, C#, Go, Kotlin, Python, R, Rust, Scala, Swift, Javascript, Typescript, LLVM IR, and Scheme. Additionally, it has primitive support for text and prototypical support for EMF metamodels. A detailed list, including the supported language versions, can be found in the [project readme](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/blob/main/README.md#supported-languages).

The language modules differ in maturity due to their age and differing usage frequencies.
Thus, each frontend has a state label:
- `mature`: This module is tried and tested and is (somewhat) up to date with the current language version.
- `beta`: This module is relatively new and (somewhat) up to date. However, it has not been tested as well. **Feedback welcome!**
- `alpha`: This module is very new and has not yet been finished. Use with caution! 
- `legacy`: This module is from JPlag legacy (pre-v3.0.0) and may only support outdated language versions. It needs an update.
- `unknown`: It is very unclear which state this module is in.

All language modules can be found [here](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/tree/master/languages).
