JPlag has two different types of end-to-end tests.

# Maven end-to-end-tests
There is a module inside the maven project, that runs e2e tests on the core of Jplag.
The basic structure of the end-to-end testing module is discussed in the [corresponding readme file](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/blob/master/endtoend-testing/README.md).

# Complete end-to-end-tests
The complete end-to-end tests are executed by the [complete e2e tests workflow](../../../.github/workflows/complete-e2e.yml) and are meant to check the entire process from building and executing JPlag to viewing the report in the report viewer. Details are specified in the [corresponding readme file](../report-viewer/tests/e2e/README.md).
