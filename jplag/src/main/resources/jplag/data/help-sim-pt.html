<h1>Match ranking</h1>

<p>JPlag compares programs by trying to cover one of the programs with
(preferably big) sequences from the other program. The coverage of a program
is defined as the ratio of covered source code to the total size of the source
code.</p>

<h4>Rank matches by average similarity</h4>

<p>The average similarity is defined as the average of both program
coverages.<br/>
This is the default similarity which works in most cases: Matches with a high
average similarity indicate that the programs work in a very similar way.</b>

<h4>Rank matches by maximum similarity</h4>

<p>The maximum similarity is defined as the maximum of both program
coverages.<br/>
This ranking is especially useful if the programs are very different in
size. This can happen when dead code was inserted to disguise the origin
of the plagiarized program.</p>
