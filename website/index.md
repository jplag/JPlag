# Overview
JPlag is a state-of-the-art source code plagiarism detector. It allows one to check a set of programs for suspicious similarities and thus helps its users tackle plagiarism detection at scale in an ethical way. JPlag compares the structure of the programs by extracting an abstraction layer from their parse trees. Thus, it is resilient to attempts to obfuscate the plagiarism. JPlag offers a powerful graphical interface to analyze its result, allowing to detect outliers and trace similarities between pairs of suspicious programs. JPlag is open-source and can be executed locally, thus complying with the GDPR.

JPlag was created in 1996 and is still actively developed and maintained at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). JPlag supports Java, C#, C, C++, Python, Javascript, Typescript, Go, R, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, and other languages.
