# JPlag Report Viewer

The JPlag Report Viewer is a web application that can be used to display the zip file generated by JPlag. 


## Project setup
The application requires Node.js and npm to be installed on the system.
```
npm install
```

### Run the development server
```
npm run dev
```

### Compile and build
There are different ways to build the report-viewer.

The report viewer will be built and packaged with the cli in a jar file if built with the `with-report-viewer` profile:
```
mvn -Pwith-report-viewer clean package assembly:single
```

To build it in the standard way, without any base url, run:
```
npm run build
```

For production builds (for example to host on GitHub Pages in a repository called `JPlag`) run:
```
npm run build:prod
```
When hosting this build it will need to be accessible under `yourdomain.tld/JPlag/`.

To build the demo version run:
```
npm run build:demo
```
Similar to the production build, this build will have `demo` as its base url.
