# JPlag Report Viewer

The JPlag Report Viewer is a web application that can be used to display the report file generated by JPlag. 


## Project setup
The application requires Node.js and npm to be installed on the system.
```

```

### Run the development server

mvn -Pwith-report-viewer clean package assembly:single
```

To build a standalone report-viewer run:
```
npm run build
```
